# Session Handover Summary - Korean Dialogue Summarization Project

## 📊 **Current Status: Progress Made but Critical Issues Remain**

### **Latest Performance Results**
- **Previous Run**: ROUGE-F1: 0.1677 → **Current Run**: ROUGE-F1: 0.1606
- **Issue**: Still extremely low performance (target: 47.1244 ROUGE-F1)
- **New Problem**: **#Person# tokens missing from outputs** - critical for dialogue structure

### **Key Findings from Recent Work**

#### ✅ **Data Understanding Complete (EDA Results)**
- **Dataset**: 12,457 train, 499 dev, 499 test samples
- **Dialogue Structure**: Mostly 2-speaker (12,335/12,457), avg 84 words → 16 words summary
- **Compression Ratio**: 0.23 (summaries are ~23% of input length)
- **Korean Patterns**: Clean data, proper Korean endings (다.), minimal preprocessing needed

#### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Identified**
1. **Model generating continuations instead of summaries** (confirmed in validation samples)
2. **#Person# tokens disappearing** from outputs (new issue you noticed)
3. **Length control not working** - outputs still too long and unfocused
4. **ROUGE scores remain extremely low** despite configuration fixes

#### 📝 **Evidence from Latest Run (summarization_fix)**
```
Input: "#Person1# : 안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요? #Person2# : 요즘 숨쉬기가 힘들어요..."
Ground Truth: "는 숨쉬기 어려워합니다. 의사는 에게 증상을 확인하고, 천식 검사를 위해 폐 전문의에게 가볼 것을 권합니다."
Prediction: "은  에게 천식 검사를 위해 폐 전문의에게 가보라고 권장합니다. 천식은 주로 활동할 때 나타나는 알레르기가 아니며..."
```

**Problems Observed:**
- Missing #Person# tokens (showing as empty spaces)
- Still generating continuations vs summaries
- ROUGE-1: 0.0000 (complete mismatch)

## 🔧 **Implemented Solutions This Session**

### **Configuration Updates Created**
1. **`configs/experiment/summarization_fix.yaml`** - Length control focus
2. **Enhanced preprocessing logic** - Korean summarization prompts
3. **Postprocessing improvements** - Summary validation

### **Key Config Changes Applied**
- `max_target_length: 80` (reduced from 120 based on EDA)
- `generation.max_length: 80` (force shorter outputs)
- `length_penalty: 2.0` (strong penalty for long outputs)
- `lr: 1e-4` (increased learning rate)

## 🚨 **Critical Issues for Next Session**

### **1. #Person# Token Issue (TOP PRIORITY)**
- **Problem**: Reference summaries use `#Person1#` but predictions show empty spaces
- **Likely Cause**: Tokenizer or postprocessing removing these tokens
- **Impact**: Makes evaluation impossible (can't match ground truth format)

### **2. Model Behavior Issue**
- **Problem**: Still generating continuations despite length penalties
- **Evidence**: Outputs read like dialogue continuations, not summaries
- **Root Cause**: Model hasn't learned summarization task properly

### **3. Baseline Gap Analysis Needed**
- **Current**: 0.16 ROUGE-F1
- **Target**: 47.12 ROUGE-F1 
- **Gap**: 294x performance difference indicates fundamental issues

## 🎯 **Immediate Actions for Next Session**

### **Priority 1: Fix #Person# Token Handling**
```bash
# Debug tokenizer behavior
python -c "
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('digit82/kobart-summarization')
print('Person1 tokens:', tokenizer.tokenize('#Person1#'))
print('Person2 tokens:', tokenizer.tokenize('#Person2#'))
"

# Check if postprocessing is removing them
python scripts/inference.py predict [checkpoint] --override postprocessing.korean_specific.remove_special_markers=false
```

### **Priority 2: Baseline Model Analysis**
```bash
# Test baseline model directly on your data
python model_diagnostic.py  # (script created this session)

# Compare with original KoBART performance
python -c "
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration
model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('digit82/kobart-summarization')
# Test on sample dialogues
"
```

### **Priority 3: Training Strategy Revision**
- Investigate why model isn't learning summarization task
- Consider different base model (gogamza/kobart-base-v2)
- Implement stronger prompt engineering during training

## 📁 **Files Created/Modified This Session**

### **New Files**
1. `korean_dialogue_eda.py` - Comprehensive data analysis (completed)
2. `model_diagnostic.py` - Model performance testing
3. `configs/experiment/quick_fix.yaml` - Initial config fix
4. `configs/experiment/summarization_fix.yaml` - Length-focused config
5. `eda_analysis_report.json` - Complete data analysis results

### **Key Insights from EDA**
- **Data is clean and well-structured**
- **Korean patterns are consistent**
- **Compression ratio is very aggressive (0.23)**
- **Most dialogues are 2-speaker conversations**

## 🔄 **Next Session Continuation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Debug #Person# Tokens (1 hour)**
1. Investigate tokenizer handling of special tokens
2. Check postprocessing configuration
3. Verify ground truth format expectations

### **Phase 2: Model Behavior Analysis (2 hours)**
1. Test baseline KoBART directly on your data
2. Compare with your fine-tuned model outputs
3. Identify why summarization isn't being learned

### **Phase 3: Alternative Approaches (if needed)**
1. Different base model (gogamza/kobart-base-v2)
2. Stronger training signals (label smoothing, different loss)
3. Prompt-based training approach

## 💡 **Key Research Direction**

The fundamental issue appears to be that the model is treating this as a **text completion task** rather than a **summarization task**. The next session should focus on:

1. **Fixing token handling** to match evaluation format
2. **Understanding why summarization behavior isn't emerging**
3. **Potentially switching to a different training approach**

The EDA shows your data is good quality, so the issue is in model training/configuration, not data preparation.
