# Session Handover Summary - Model Performance Still Poor After Padding Fix

## **Current Status: PADDING FIXED BUT PERFORMANCE STILL CRITICAL**

### **✅ Progress Made**
- **Padding Issue RESOLVED**: You correctly identified that `padding=False` in preprocessing was needed to allow CollateFunction to apply -100 padding
- **WandB Integration Working**: Metrics are being logged and run names are updating correctly
- **Training Completing**: 8 epochs completed in ~28 minutes

### **❌ Critical Issues Remaining**

#### **1. Extremely Poor Performance**
```
eval/rouge_f: 0.0309 (should be ~0.47+ like baseline)
eval/rouge1_f: 0.0446 (should be ~0.50+)
eval/rouge2_f: 0.0039 (should be ~0.20+)
```

**Your model is still performing ~15x worse than expected.**

#### **2. WandB Dashboard Missing Summary/Config**
- Overview tab not showing Summary Metrics or Config data
- Metrics are being logged but not appearing in UI properly

## **Root Cause Analysis: Generation Configuration**

### **Primary Issue: Greedy Search During Validation**
Your current generation config in `configs/training/baseline.yaml`:
```yaml
generation:
  num_beams: 1           # ← GREEDY SEARCH (poor quality)
  early_stopping: false  # ← Disabled with num_beams=1
  length_penalty: 1.2    # ← Incompatible with greedy search
```

**Problem**: Greedy search (`num_beams: 1`) generates poor quality summaries during validation, leading to terrible ROUGE scores and preventing the model from learning effectively.

### **Secondary Issues**
1. **Length penalty warning**: Not compatible with `num_beams: 1`
2. **Model checkpoint saving**: Based on poor validation scores due to greedy search
3. **WandB summary**: Not being explicitly updated for dashboard display

## **Immediate Fixes Required**

### **Fix 1: Enable Beam Search for Validation**
```yaml
# In configs/training/baseline.yaml
generation:
  max_length: 100
  min_length: 1
  num_beams: 4           # ← CHANGED from 1 to 4
  no_repeat_ngram_size: 3
  early_stopping: true   # ← CHANGED from false
  do_sample: false
  repetition_penalty: 1.2
  length_penalty: 2.0    # ← NOW compatible with beam search
```

### **Fix 2: Update WandB Summary in base_model.py**
```python
# Add to on_test_epoch_end() method in src/models/base_model.py
def on_test_epoch_end(self) -> None:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # ✅ ADD: Explicitly update WandB summary for dashboard
    if self.logger and hasattr(self.logger.experiment, "summary"):
        summary_metrics = {f"final_{k}": v for k, v in flat_scores.items()}
        self.logger.experiment.summary.update(summary_metrics)
```

## **Expected Results After Fixes**
- **ROUGE scores**: Should jump from ~0.03 to ~0.15-0.25 immediately
- **Training efficiency**: Better models saved due to accurate validation scores
- **WandB dashboard**: Summary metrics visible in Overview tab

## **Current Model Status**
- **Architecture**: Working correctly (223M parameters)
- **Tokenization**: Fixed (special tokens working)
- **Data Pipeline**: Fixed (padding issue resolved)
- **Training Loop**: Working but hampered by poor validation

## **Files Needing Updates**
1. **`configs/training/baseline.yaml`** - Enable beam search ⭐
2. **`src/models/base_model.py`** - Add WandB summary update ⭐

## **Next Session Continuation Prompt**

```
Continue dialogue summarization project. Padding issue resolved but model performance still critical (ROUGE-F1: 0.03 vs expected 0.47+).

Root cause identified: Using greedy search (num_beams=1) during validation produces poor quality summaries, leading to terrible ROUGE scores and ineffective training.

Immediate fixes needed:
1. Change num_beams from 1 to 4 in configs/training/baseline.yaml
2. Enable early_stopping=true and add length_penalty=2.0 
3. Add WandB summary update in base_model.py for dashboard display

Expected improvement: ROUGE scores should jump from ~0.03 to ~0.15-0.25 immediately after enabling beam search for validation.

Current status: Model architecture and data pipeline working correctly, only generation config preventing proper performance measurement.
```

## **Key Insights Gained**
1. **Padding was indeed the blocker** - your fix was correct
2. **Validation generation quality directly impacts training** - poor validation scores prevent good model checkpoints
3. **Beam search is essential** for accurate ROUGE measurement during validation
4. **Model is likely learning correctly** but being measured poorly due to greedy search

The model may actually be performing much better than the scores indicate - the beam search fix should reveal the true performance level.

**Priority**: Apply generation config fixes first, then retrain for 1-2 epochs to verify dramatic improvement in ROUGE scores.
