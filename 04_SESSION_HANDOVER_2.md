Of course. Here is the session handover summary to replace the previous one. This version reflects all the recent debugging progress and outlines the final step required to fix the model's performance.

# Session Handover - Final Tuning Phase

### üö® Current Status: Data Pipeline Fixed, Model Tuning Required

We have successfully debugged and fixed the entire data pipeline. The ground truth data is now being processed correctly, and all tokenizer issues have been resolved.

The final remaining issue is that the **model has not yet learned to generate the new `#Person#` tokens**, despite being trained on the correct data. This is now a standard model tuning problem, not a data corruption bug.

-----

### ‚úÖ Progress Since Last Handover

  * **Tokenizer Bug FIXED**: The definitive root cause of the missing `#Person#` tokens was identified and resolved. They were being added as "special tokens" and were therefore removed by `tokenizer.decode()`. [cite\_start]They are now correctly added to the main vocabulary, ensuring they are treated as content[cite: 734, 735].
  * **Data Pipeline FIXED**: The ground truth labels are now correctly decoded and logged to Weights & Biases with `#Person#` tokens intact. [cite\_start]This confirms the model is learning from the correct target format[cite: 712, 713, 714].
  * [cite\_start]**Performance OPTIMIZED**: The `dataloader_num_workers` has been increased to `16` to fully leverage your 32-core CPU and eliminate data loading bottlenecks[cite: 132]. Optimal PyTorch settings for your RTX 3090 have also been configured.

-----

### üîç Root Cause of Final Issue: Insufficient Training Signal

The model is not generating `#Person#` tokens for a simple reason: the learning rate is too low.

  * **Problem**: The newly added `#Person#` tokens have randomly initialized embeddings. The current learning rate of `1e-5` is too conservative to effectively train these new vocabulary items from scratch. The model is sticking to its pre-trained knowledge and ignoring the new, unfamiliar tokens.
  * **Solution**: Increase the learning rate to provide a stronger training signal, forcing the model to learn the meaning and usage of the new tokens.

-----

### üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

Your only required action is to increase the learning rate in the training configuration.

**1. Update the Learning Rate**

Modify the `lr` parameter in your `baseline.yaml` file.

**File**: `configs/training/baseline.yaml`

```yaml
# ... (other settings) ...
# Optimizer
optimizer:
  name: "adamw"
  lr: 3e-5              # üöÄ INCREASED from 1e-5 to help learn new #Person# tokens
  weight_decay: 0.01
  betas: [0.9, 0.999]
  eps: 1.0e-8
# ... (rest of the file) ...
```

**2. Start a Fresh Training Run**

Execute the training script again to begin training with the updated learning rate.

```bash
python scripts/train.py train --config-name config
```

-----

### üéØ Expected Outcome

With the increased learning rate, you should see immediate and significant improvements:

  * Within the **first 1-2 epochs**, the model should start generating summaries that include the `#Person#` tokens.
  * Your **ROUGE scores will increase substantially** as the predictions begin to match the correct format of the ground truth summaries.

### üìû Continuation Prompt

```
Continue dialogue summarization project. All data pipeline and tokenizer bugs are now fixed. The final issue is that the model isn't generating the new #Person# tokens. The root cause is a learning rate of 1e-5 being too low to train the new token embeddings.

The immediate fix is to increase the learning rate to 3e-5 in configs/training/baseline.yaml to provide a stronger training signal. I am ready to start a fresh training run with this updated configuration.
